## Project Overview

A production-ready nutrition analysis platform built with modern web technologies and enterprise architecture patterns. This application demonstrates advanced React development, clean architecture principles, and professional software engineering practices.

### Technical Highlights
- **Clean Architecture** - Domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
- **Enterprise Service Pattern** - 15+ modular services with dependency injection
- **Type-Safe Development** - Full TypeScript implementation with strict mode
- **Comprehensive Testing** - 90% code coverage with Jest and React Testing Library
- **Performance Optimized** - < 500KB bundle size, lazy loading, service-level caching
- **Security First** - OWASP compliance, input sanitization, CSP headers
- **Production Ready** - Docker containerization, CI/CD pipeline, monitoring

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ LTS
- npm 9+ or yarn 3+
- Modern browser (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nutriforge/nutriforge-pro.git
cd nutriforge-pro

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 💡 Application Use Case

### Nutrition Planning Workflow
This platform calculates essential nutrition metrics (BMR, TDEE, macronutrients, hydration) based on user inputs. After obtaining calculated values from NutriForge Pro, users can leverage AI assistants like ChatGPT for detailed meal planning.

### Example ChatGPT Prompt Template
After using NutriForge Pro to calculate your nutrition goals, use this prompt with ChatGPT:

```
You are a highly accurate nutrition assistant.
I want you to calculate and help me refine a meal plan for my [cutting/bulking/maintenance] phase.

📊 Target Nutrition Goal:
• Protein: [value from NutriForge]g
• Fat: [value from NutriForge]g
• Carbs: [value from NutriForge]g
• Fiber: [recommended value]g

[Provide your meal plan with ingredients for AI to optimize quantities]
```

The AI will then:
1. Calculate per-ingredient nutrition breakdowns
2. Provide meal-by-meal summaries
3. Refine quantities to match macro goals
4. Estimate grocery costs and quantities
