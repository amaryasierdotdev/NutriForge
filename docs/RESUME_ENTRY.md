### Detailed Technical Version

**NutriForge Pro - Personal Nutrition Calculator Project**

A web-based nutrition calculator I developed to demonstrate proficiency in modern React development and clean code architecture.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Built with React 18 and TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Created custom calculation service implementing Mifflin-St Jeor equation for BMR calculation
- Developed algorithms for macro distribution based on body composition and fitness goals
- Implemented responsive design with styled-components and CSS-in-JS approach
- Added smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion library
- Created reusable component library with 30+ UI components
- Implemented local storage persistence for user preferences and data
- Added comprehensive input validation and error handling

**Key Features Developed:**
- Real-time nutrition calculations (calories, protein, fat, carbs, fiber)
- Body composition analysis (BMI, BMR, TDEE, lean body mass)
- Support for different activity levels and fitness goals
- Dark/light theme toggle with system preference detection
- Responsive design working on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Data export functionality in multiple formats
- Keyboard shortcuts for improved UX
- Multi-language support infrastructure

**Architecture Decisions:**
- Separated business logic into dedicated service classes
- Used custom React hooks for state management and side effects
- Implemented component composition pattern for reusability
- Applied performance optimizations with React.memo and useMemo
- Structured project with clear separation of concerns

## How to Present This Project

### In Interviews:
- Emphasize the problem it solves: helping people calculate their nutritional needs
- Discuss technical decisions: why React, why TypeScript, why styled-components
- Mention challenges overcome: calculation accuracy, responsive design, performance
- Show you can build complete, polished applications independently

### On GitHub:
- Ensure the README is professional and includes setup instructions
- Add screenshots showing the UI and key features
- Include a live demo link if deployed
- Keep the code clean and well-commented

### What Makes This Project Stand Out:
- Complete, functional application (not just a tutorial follow-along)
- Professional UI/UX with attention to detail
- Clean code architecture showing understanding of best practices
- Multiple complex features working together cohesively
- Responsive design that works well on all devices

## Notes for Your Resume

- Present this as a **personal project** that showcases your skills
- Be prepared to discuss the code and technical decisions in interviews
- Can mention it's "in development" if you plan to add more features
- Focus on the technical skills it demonstrates, not inflated metrics
- Be honest about what you built yourself vs what came from libraries
